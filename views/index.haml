%h2 Remotely

%p
    Just query
    %a{:href => '/api/n'}= "#{request.base_url}/api/n"
    where n is an integer from 1 to 100 representing the amount of lines you need. You will get these in JSON format.
    %br
    For the record, this is the exact same API this application itself queries when you use it.
